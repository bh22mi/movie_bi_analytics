# 🎬 BI Project: Movie Ratings Analytics

This project showcases a complete **Business Intelligence pipeline** using a movie ratings dataset — including data modeling, SQL analytics, and BI-focused insights.

## 📦 Dataset Used

- `dim_movie.csv`
- `dim_user.csv`
- `dim_date.csv`
- `fact_rating.csv`

These datasets were cleaned using Excel and Python and then imported into MySQL using the CSV Import Wizard.

## 🗃️ Dimensional Model (Star Schema)

The data model follows a **star schema** design:

- `fact_rating`: Central fact table storing movie ratings
- `dim_movie`: Contains movie details like name, genre, release date
- `dim_user`: Contains user attributes like gender and country
- `dim_date`: Contains time-based attributes for date-based analysis

## 🧼 Data Cleaning

Performed using both **Excel** and **Python (pandas)**.

🔹 Excel:
- Preliminary cleanup
- Removing empty columns, fixing formats

🔹 Python:
- Parsed nested JSON-style genre values
- Created flattened structure for genre and dates
- Exported cleaned CSVs for import
